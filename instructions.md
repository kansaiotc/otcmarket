Sellers
==========

Our goal with sellers is

- maintain control over their coins

- avoid at all costs, assuming the price volatility risk. If the OTC market ever takes that risk, the risk will quickly go bankrupt

Watching only standard wallet
-----------------------------------

Without approval from the seller, it's impossible for a watching-only wallet to send coins from your wallet. Meaning the seller always maintains absolute control over their coins. The seller takes no additional risk at all.

A watching only wallet, the OTC market can "make a send transaction" and then "Save" the transaction to a file. The OTC market just has no way to sign or broadcast the transaction. Completely rely upon the cooperation of the seller.

The OTC market sends the transaction file to the seller. Who signs and broadcasts it. The OTC market can see immediately, from the read-only wallet, when the transaction has been executed

The requirement is that the seller has an electrum wallet installed and learns how to import unsigned transactions, sign it, and broadcast it. That's quite a few steps, so we will try to provide a step by step howto

How to set up your wallet
----------------------------

Make a standard or 2FA wallet. Minimal requirement is a standard electrum wallet

Please send your public master key, so OTC market can make a watching only wallet

From electrum wallet menu, open either Wallet->Information or Wallet->Master public key. Copy the master public key and send it to OTC market by an encrypted messenger

Posting trades
================

We only post members: nickname, coin, amount, trade type \[buy | sell | coin backed loan\], date

Members can contact us to post a trade request OR submit a pull request (only updating their own trade, nothing else)

Trade settlement
==================

This OTC market has no settlement layer and never will. Meaning there is no payment option besides cash

Our strength is in

- Our connections. Which we build up through participation in our local community and interpersonal relationships.

- Market demand / ease of use. For various reasons, not everyone has kyc exchange accounts or local bank accounts. So **there will always be demand** and willingness to pay a fee for facilitating trades with the least number of steps  

- Setting up a sellers network. This critical piece is not obvious how to do. You don't even need to be a miner or a whale. Anyone can become a seller. There is no minimum coin requirement

- We will track post the trades to the top of this page and move instructions to another file

How to contact us
===================

We will post messenger contact info here. This will use an encrypted anonymous messenger app. So not LINE, fb messenger, nor email. We will also phase out our use of telegram desktop messenger. When i2p protocal messengers become available we will favor those.

Will go with xmpp first. And also look at discord

Censorship resistant
=========================

Ideally a decentralized coin would be more censorship resistant. But we've chosen a non-technical methods.

What put our faith in people rather than a technological solution.

This market is based only on text files. Which are easy to backup, publish, and move to another host. In case we have to move hosts, we know all our members personally and can easily reach out to all of them and inform them on our new home. 

The tiny explanation here is enough to spread the knowledge of how to make your own local OTC market. Copy and paste this whole site and go do it with our blessings
