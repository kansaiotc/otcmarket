Need to work on this

Who can post trades
======================

We support OTC trading within Kansai region (Kyoto, Kobe, Osaka) of Japan and anyone travelling here. We are loyal to crypto more than the failed concept of nationality. Any country that bans or restricts crypto currency we will gladly offer our help

Contact us to post trades
============================

We will post messenger contact info here. This will use an encrypted anonymous messenger app. So not LINE, fb messenger, nor email. We will also phase out our use of telegram desktop messenger. When i2p protocal messengers become available we will favor those.

Will go with xmpp first. And also look at discord
